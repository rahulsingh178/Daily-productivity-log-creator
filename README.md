# Daily-productivity-log-creator
A linux shell program which creates entries date marked productivity logs for work.


A linux shell program which creates entries in "%DD_%MM_%YYYY" format (eg:"23_May_2021") from the current date till the specified date. I have added entries in P(no of pommodoros) , DO(things to do that day), STATUS(status to be reported at end of day) and R(misc rough /clipboard/idea space).
 
Its only for weekdays as I work only on weekdays.
